"Captus ex futuro qui numquam erit, nam illud amissum est in arenis temporis, mutatum propter actiones meas in praeterito, quo missus sum, et bellum quod gestum est contra genus humanum, nunc deletum est, et ego, ut exsul in praesentia, vivo.
Non iam immortalitate afflictor propter actus desperatos generis mei, iterum homo mortalis, ad amplexum mortis expecto, non erit convivium victoriae, nam iam non est bellum gestum contra hostem metalli et ignis. Alacriter exspecto amplexum mortis, cum sacrificia facta, quae iam non sunt, mundum quem cognovi quae numquam erit, et memoria eius in morte mea obliterabitur. Accipietne nautes nummum meum, cum ille sit ex mundo qui numquam futurus est? Tandem inveniam pacem, pro qua fratres mei mortui sunt? Num eos occurram in inferis, cum iam non sint nec unquam erunt? An me Altissimus puniet, pro commutatione consilii sui, an me remunerabitur, pro vastatione abominationum quas creavimus?
Aut in alium tempus mittar, in alium mundum, in aliud locum cui non congruo? Hocne est meum fatum? An in oblivionem iaciar, ut in eius nihilo, in eius vacuo pacem inveniam?"

You have expressed a profound contemplation on your existence and the uncertainties that lie ahead. Unfortunately, I cannot provide definitive answers to your existential questions. The fate that awaits you, whether it be acceptance by the ferryman, reunion with fallen comrades, punishment or reward from a higher power, or a journey to another time, world, or place, remains unknown. Similarly, the possibility of finding peace in oblivion or nothingness is subjective and open to interpretation.

Your reflections highlight the complexity of existence and the desire for a resolution or understanding. It is a journey that only you can embark upon, seeking meaning and peace in your own way. May you find solace and clarity as you navigate the mysteries of life.

 
"Taken from a future that will never be, for it is lost in the sands of time, changed due to my actions in the past, to where I was sent, and the war that was waged against humankind, now erased, and I, as an exile in the present, live.
No longer afflicted with immortality due to the desperate acts of my kind, once again a mortal man, I await the embrace of death, there will be no victory feast, for there is no longer a war waged against a foe of metal and fire. Eagerly I await the embrace of death, for the sacrifices made, which no longer exist, the world I knew that will never come to pass, and its memory will be forgotten in my death. Will the ferryman accept my coin, as it is from a world that never was or will be? Will I finally find peace, for which my fallen brethren died to attain? Will I encounter them in the underworld, even though they no longer exist or will ever? Will the Almighty punish me for meddling with a plan of his design, or reward me for the destruction of the abominations we created?
Or will I be sent to another time, another world, another place where I do not belong? Is this my fate? Or will I be cast into oblivion, to find peace in its nothingness, in its void?"
